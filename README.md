# vk-downloader
Fast Python tool for downloading videos from vk.com
Forked from https://github.com/sergei-bondarenko/vk-downloader

vk changed their API, so script only downloads in 240 now(((
I'm currently researching, how to get m3u8 files from their new URLs

Usage (only downloads 240 now):
```
python3 main.py https://vk.com/video1315763_456239439
```
Also supports decomposition of custom URLs
